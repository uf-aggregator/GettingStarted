#Aggregator Best Practices && Style Guide

*This is the best practices and style guide for the UF Aggregator codebase.*

----------------------------------------------------------
###Naming
In order to keep code uniform and easily readable by members, use the following naming conventions,

* **ROS Packages** - lowercase _with _underscores
* **ROS Nodes** - lowercase_ with _underscores _plus _node _at _the _end _node
* **ROS Message Files** - [UpperCamelCase](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CamelCase)
* **ROS Service Files** - same as ROS Message Files.
* **Files**
	* **C++**	- same as ROS Nodes
	* **Scripts** - [camelCase](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CamelCase)
* **Classes** - same as ROS Message Files
* **Variables**
	* **Persistant Variables** - same as ROS Packages
		* Like i2c _current _value.
	* **Other variables** - same as script files.

----------------------------------------------------------
###ROS
In order to lower redundancy and help organize everything, follow these practices when working with ROS,

* One interface, one package
	* ex.) Camera system is one package. This package does the feed, the transforms, and any computations related to the camera system.
* Don't make a new message file, if it exists elsewhere
	* You can import message files from other packages in your packages src/CMakeList.txt
* The same goes for service, action, and C++ header files.

----------------------------------------------------------
###Classes
AggreGator relies on a mixture of functional and object oriented programming. In order to utilize the best of both, follow these practices.
	**_Reminder_** OOP is object-oriented programming and focuses on extending classes and creating classes for every function. Functional programming focuses on writing generally applicable functions and calling them directly where needed.

* **Functional Programming**
	* This should be kept in its own header and header definition files. These are functions that any node of a particular type will need to use.
	* These should be purely .h files.
	* ex.) Hardware interfacing like I2C functions. Though I2C functions can be wrapped into a class, you may only need exactly one function from the suite, so it's better for memory and processing to just call that directly.
* **OOP**
	* This should be any system in the robot, i.e. handler for the entire camera system should be OOP. Autonomy should be OOP
	* Classes should not be made for just a few functions. Use OOP when you have a whole suite of functions you need to add or a slew of publishing and
	* ex.) Hardware interfacing like I2C functions. Though I2C functions can be wrapped into a class, you may only need exactly one function from the suite, so it's better for memory and processing to just call that directly. subscribing you need to carry out.

----------------------------------------------------------
###Variables
These are best practices for keeping code manageable and uncluttered through good variable use

* **No Global Variables**
	* If you can help it. In functional programming, the functions just handle input of a certain kind and output of a certain kind.
	* e.g. Assume whoever is using the function knows it needs, say, a 5 char array.
* **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**
	* If you have a series of variables ( > 3) that you need, just make an array.
	* If you need global variables, just encapsulate the method in a class that holds those data members. 

----------------------------------------------------------
###Paths
Just use relative paths whenever possible.

ex.) Pretend you're using /home/catkin_workspace/src/FileINeed.txt for some IO op. The file you're writing the IO code in is at /home/catkin_workspace/src/SomePackage/src/MyCode.cpp.
Rather than specifying the absolute path, use

`../../FileINeed.txt`

In case /home/catkin_workspace is not the path to the workspace.

---------------------------------------------------------
###Comments
Always leave comments in the following form or at least leave enough small comments so that someone can compile them into this form

#####C++
        /********************************************
        *FunctionName(arg1, arg2)
        *    Arguments:
        *        arg1 - an int, preferably within (0,5)
        *        arg2 - a string, no spaces
        *    This function will take an int and a string and then output a death ray.
        ********************************************/
        
        DeathRay FunctionName(int arg1, string arg2) {
            ...//code here...
        }
        
#####Python


#####Scripts
For batch files, bash files, script files, etc.

        #Run the roslaunch file
        roslaunch startScript.sh

#####Other
For files like the CMakeList, .launch, package.xml, HTML files, etc.

        #CMakeList.txt               
        #Add xx to the library
        find_libraries(xx)
        

        <!--Run the xx node-->
        <node></node>
